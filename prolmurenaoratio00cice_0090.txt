52 PRO L. MURENA. [g 3

sustentata: substituted for sustenta, which is rarely used.

quod. si. hebebit: ‘but if, in suing for the recovery of
such things as are formally transferred, it is the duty of one
who has bound himself by a legal obligation to stand the
risk of a decision, with still more justice, surely, in the trial
of a consul elect, that man before all others, who has de-
clared him consul, will be bound to become the guarantee of
the honour conferred by the Roman people and to be the man
to repel the danger '. Res mancipi were things that passed
from the possession of one person to another by the process
of mancipatio (taking in the hand) in which a regular formal
ceremony was observed. In the presence of six grown-u
persons, five of whom acted as witnesses, the purchaser too
hold of the thing that was to become his property. The
sixth (who was called libripens) held a pair of scales. The
purchaser struck the scales with a small piece of copper (aes)
which he handed to the seller: this formed a transaction per
aes et libram : cp. Hor. Epp. 11. 2, 158, si proprium est, quod
quis libra mercatus et aere est. Such sales were always ac-
companied by a warranty or guarantee of title. Thus, if A
transferred property to B, and C stepped in and claimed it
(repetere), then A was bound either to make good his right
to dispose of it to B, or to reimburse him for any loss he

projegto: ‘ surely then ' : this word is often found in ¹
Cicero with the Future in the Apodosis of a Conditional
Sentence. He never uses it as a simple affirmative particle
(‘ in truth ')‚ but always to denote that the speaker wishes to

represent somethingxas his own personal opinion.

praestare: Cicero is bound to make good Murena’s title
to the consulship. The office is regarded as a res mancipi:
Cicero is the seller (venditor), and Murena the purchaser
(emptor).

augtor: ‘guarantor'z cp. Ernesti, clavis Cic. s. v. ἓ 11:
est venditor, qui suum esse spondet, quod vendit, et eius ven-

dendi se potestatem habere. He is a person who sells οι·
conveys a thing to another, and pledges himself that he has

. a right to do so ς cp. in Verr. v. 22 a malo auctore emere.

beneficium: see ἓ 2.
