it is a piece of impertinence on the part of Postumus, who was
a candidate for the praetorship, suddenly to abandon his own

better men than he.

ita: not to be taken with mavis, in the sense of ‘so
weighty that ’ but = ‘ although ', i. e. the sentence is conces-
sive, and ut (with tamen thrown into the second clause)=
‘yet ', ‘notwithstanding '. The sense is: I am more afraid
of his personal influence than of the weight of the charges
he may bring against Murena, in spite of his undoubted
Δ powers as a prosecuting counsel.
