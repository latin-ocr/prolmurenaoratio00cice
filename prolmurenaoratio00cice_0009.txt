PREFAOE.

THIS Edition makes no pretence of competing with
Mr. Heitlaud’s‚ which has long enjoyed a high re·
putation, and is intended for a more advanced class
of readers, Ι have thought it better to avoid con-
sulting his Notes, except in very few instances.

The two editions of which I have made constant
use are those of Halm-Laubmann (Berlin, 1893) and
Koch-Landgraf (Leipzig, 1885). The text is that of
the first-named. A Short Oritical Appendix has been
added, giving the more important various readings.

The Grammars referred to in the Notes are Dr.
Kennedy’s Public School Latin Grammar and Roby's
Latin Grammar for Schools (R).

I shall be much obliged if schoolmasters and others

¹ who happen to use the book will point out any errors

they may come across.
