eciam cum Catone meo saepe dissensi. nimis mihi praefractum
aeggriumnvecciqaliaque defendere, omma publicanis negare,

cave grana: i.e. the wise man must not allow himself
to be influenced by any personal considerations of sriendship.

supplicos: predicate: aliqui with miseri.

mens s1 feceris ε ‘ you will prove yourself if you do ’.
⁴ When two Future actions are brought into connection, and
both actions will be complete together, both verbs are in the
Future Perfect: ad Fam. x. 19, qui Antonium oppresserit, is
bellum confecerit' ; Pub. Sch. L. Gr. § 229, 3. Halm says

ficeris is Potential = εις.

at leve delictum est: ‘well but, you may say, it is only a
slight failing ⁹.

dinsti flagitium ι ‘ You made some remark ⁵, says some
one to the Stoic. ‘It is fixed and settled ², says he. ‘ You
were infiuenced not by the facts, but by mere opinion '.
‘ The wise man never opines '. ‘ You made a slight mistake ’.
[Then, instead of giving the Stoic’s answer in his own words,
Cicero puts it as a remark of his own.] He thinks he is being
insulted. Here we have the following results of this system
of philosophy. ‘I declared in the senate '‚ says Cato, ‘that
I would impeach some candidate for the consulship ’. ‘Yes‚
but you said it in anger ’. ‘The wise man is never angry ’,γ
replies Cato. ‘ Well, then, you said it to suit the moment ⁹.
⁴ It is the behaviour of a wicked man to deceive by a lie ε to
change one's opinion, is disgraceful: to allow oneself to be
talked over, is a sin : to show pity, a. crime ’.

quippiam: ‘some casual remark' ; somewhat less em-
phatic than aliquid. The MSS. reading is dimi-sti: quippe iam

fixum.

fixum et statutum est : i.e. when said, it is settled once and
for all : it cannot be altered or improved upon.

maledici putat: he considers it an insulta, because the
wise man can never be wrong.

nobis: Ethic Dative, cp. ἓ 13.

<uxi in senatu: Cato, having once declared that he in-
tended to impeach some candidate for the consulship, con-
sidered It would have been unworthy of him as a Stoic to
abandon his design, and accordingly Murena was made the
scapegoat, because Cato felt bound to accuse some one.

nomen delaturum: nomen deferre=to lay the name of
an accused person before the praetor.
