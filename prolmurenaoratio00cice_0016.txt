x PRO L. MURE'NA.

great-grandson of Marcus Porcius Cato the Censor.
He was a man of most severe morality‚ and a strict
adherent of the doctrines of the Stoic school. Feeling
strongly the evils of luxury and corruption, so rife at
Rome, he endeavoured to do what he could to check
them by his persona] example, often going without
sandals and making his journeys on foot. He carried
out his official duties with the strictest integrity. To
these qualities he united a strong feeling of patriotism,
and distinct military ability. During the Catilinarian
conspiracy, he rendered valuable assistance to Cicero,
and was mainly instrumenta] in securing the punish-
ment of the conspirators by death, in spite of the
efforts of Caesar on their behalf. After the battle
of Thapsus (13.0. 46) and defeat of the Pompeiam,
being determined not to submit to the rule of the
future master of Rome, and faithful to the principles
of his school, he committed suicide at Utica, thinking
it better to die than to look upon the face of the
tyrant. In this speech (c. xxix.) Cicero playfully
rebukes his asceticism, and criticises from a common
sense point of view the impracticable ideal of life
which he advocated.

The Servius Sulpicius, called adulescens (ἓ 88), was
tribune of the people: it is not known what was
his relationship (if any) to his namesake.

Gaius Postumus had been an unsuccessful candidate
for the praetorship during Oicero's consulship.

8. Cicero was supported by Quintus Hortensius
