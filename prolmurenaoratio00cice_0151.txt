queror of Perse(u)s, King of Macedonia, at the battle of Pydna)
had four sons and several daughters. The eldest 8011 was
adopted by Q. Fabius Maximus, the second by P. Cornelius
Scipio Africanus, the conqueror of Hannibal. The first
adopted son had a son Q. Fabius Maximus (referred to in the
next sentence) who was consul B.c. 121, and gained the cogno-
men of Allobrogicus by his victory over the Allobroges. The
second son, Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus
Minor, was the destroyer of Carthage (13.0. 146) and Numantia
(13.0. 133). One of his daughters married Q. Aelius Tubero,
by whom she had a son, the Q. Tubero mentioned here'. He
was a pupil of Panaetius of Rhodes.
