held the office of praetor, he served under Sulla in
Greece, and commanded one of the divisions of the
army in a battle near Chaeronea (13.0. 86), in
which Archelaus, the general of Mithridates, was
defeated with great loss. In Rc. 84, Sulla 0011-

following >year returned to Italy, leaving Murena
behind in Asia to settle the affairs of the country.
The latter, actuated by a desire of plunder and
eager to obtain the honour of a triumph, picked
a quarrel with Mithridates, on the ground that
he had not yet evacuated the whole of Cappadocia.
Mithridates sent a message to Rome to complain of
the conduct of Murena, who, in spite of the orders of Δ
the Senate, pushed on to the river Halys (13.0. 83), διώ
was afterwards severely defeated, and compelled to
withdraw into Phrygia. In ΒΩ. 81, Sulla sent strict
orders to Murena by Aulus Gabinius to discontinue
hostilities. He thereupon returned to Rome, and in
B.c. 80 was granted the honour of a triuinph. It is

consisted in plundering undefended country. Pos-
