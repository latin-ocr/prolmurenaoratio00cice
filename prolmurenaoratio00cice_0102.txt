64 PRO L. MURENA. [ἓ 17

Gaelfls: C. Caelius Caldus, a supportet· of the party of
Marius: consul ΚΟ. 94. He rose from nothing.

qui non modo iacebant: ‘who, in spite of their appeal-
ing, not only to such great heroes of old, as but also to those
of modern times, as nevertheless remained obscure ’. For'
commemorandis iacebant we should rather have expected com-
memoratis, tamen iacebant, and commentators explain com-
memorandis as: quamvis commemorarent, quoting de off. 1.
2, 5, quis esc emm, qui nullis officii praeceptis tradendis philo-
sophum se audeat dicere ἒ Zumpt says ‘it is a eareless sort of
instrumental ablative, for Cicero meant to write Curiis
commemorandis diqnitaeem suam frustra tuebantur ⁹.

tanto intervallo: 30 years (13.0. 93-Β.ο. 64).

claustra nobilitatis: ‘ the barrier by which noble birth is
hedged in ⁵: cp. de lege agraria, 11. 1, 3, me perlouyo intervallo
prope memoriae temporumqe nostrorum primum hominem
novum consulem fecistis et eum locum, quem nobilitas praesidiis
firmatum atque omm' ratione obvallatum tenebat, me duce
rescidistis virtutique in posterum patere voluistis.

ista : which you bring forward to the prejudice of Murena.

apud maiores nostros: since ΕΟ. 366, the date of the elec-
tion of the first plebeian consul: cp. Liv. V1. 36.

de generis novitate: the reproach of being a novus homo
could not properly be brought against Murena, as his great-
grandfather had held a curule office: the meaning is that his
family was not so old as that of Sulpicius.

duobus patriciis ε Lucius Sergius Catilina (the conspirator)
{iprddilziigkssisus Sulpicius Galba. There were also four plebeian

dignitate : ‘ persona] merit ’: gratia: ‘ popularity ’.
m ε the fact that I defeated my opponente.

profecto: see on ξ 3.

ἓ 18. quaesturam prior: The quaestore were elected at
the comitia tributa, and the candidate who first got the votes
of eighteen of the thirty-five tribes taken in order was declared

, duly elected before the others. Sulpicius is supposed to say

that he was declared quaestor first, and is consequently to be
considered superior to Murena in personal merit. Cicero re-
plies that one must be named first, but that this is no proof of
relative merit: cp. pro Plancio VI„ sunt omnes sine macula,
sunt aeque boni viri atque inteqri, sed servari necesse est yradus.

non est respondendum ad omnia: i. e. some objections are
not worth answering.
