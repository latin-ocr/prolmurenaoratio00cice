would show the chief motive of them to have been seli-interest :
ingratitude, because we ought always to be grateful to those
who have assisted our advancement. The whole passage has
been compared with a fragment of Cato the Censor (quoted by
Priscian the grammarian), nam periniurium fiat, cum mihi
ob eos mores, quoe prius habui, honos detur, ubi datus est, tum
uti eos mutem atque alii modi m'm.
