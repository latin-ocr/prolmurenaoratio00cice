INTEODUC'TION. xxix

Do not be too severe, Cato, on the institutions of our
ancestors. We Romans, who know how to alternate work
and enjoyment, have sared better than those who lived in the
greatest simplicity. Too strict adherence to Stoic principles
lost Q. Tubero, a most excellent citizen, his praetorship.
You yourself are not consistent ε you have a nomenclator (see
note on ξ 77) : judged by the standard of your school, this is

although, far from the office of consul being one to be envied,
it seems to me rather worthy of commiseration. Should he
be condemned, whit-her can he betake himself?

For the sake of his dead father and of his race and family,
