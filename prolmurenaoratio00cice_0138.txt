100 PRO L. MURENA. ’ [g 60

G. xx1x. conformare: ‘to put into shape’: Ernesti says
conformatio dicitur, cum res informis fit eleqans et formata.

11011 multa. ι the quotation is supposed to be from the
tragedy of the Myrmidones by L. Attius. There is an
allusion to the Stoic terminology: peccatum: ἁμάρτημαε rec-
tum (repsere) = κατόρθωμα.

fortissimo viro: the Dative after inquit is rare. The
fortissimus vir is Achilles, the senior mayister Phoenix or

Chiron.

verissime dixerim: ‘I think I ean most truly say’:
this use of the Subjunctive, to express modest, cautious,
or hesitating assertions, is called. Potential: the Present or
Perfect is used in reference to Present time: the Imperfect,
in reference to Past time. Thus, quaerat quispiam, ‘ some
one may ask’: velim, ‘I should like ἐ crediderim, ‘ I should
be inclined to believe': vellem, ‘I could have wished':
crederes, ‘ you would have thought'.

corrigendus inflectendus ε corriyere is the stronger word,
meaning to straighten what is quite crooked, while inflectere
is to bend back what is only slightly out of shape.

istuc: ‘ to your natural qualities? The mss. have his tot.
Earlier editions gave his dotibus, his virtutibus, or simply his.

doctrina: i.e. the teaehing of the Stoic school.
veritas: ‘ the realities ' of practical life.
natura: ‘ the feelings of nature '-

5 61. non...1n imperita multitudiue ε here Cicero is merely
flattering the jury: 118 expresses his genuine opinion de fin.
IV. 74, non eqo tecum (Cato) iam ita iocabar, ut iisdem de rebus,
cum L. Murenam defenderem. Apud imperitos tum ma dieta
sunt: aliquid etiam coronae datum: nunc aqendum eat subti-

lius.

de studiis humanitatis: ‘ intellectual pursuits '. Humanitas
:what we eall a ‘liberal education ’, as being supposed to
exereise a humanizing influence on the mind: cp. pro Archia
. poeta, ξ 2, artes, quae ad humanitatem pertinent.

requirimus : the proper meaning of requirere (like deside-
rare) is ‘ to miss or feel the want of something, to look for
something we cannot find '. Cicero says there are certain good
qualities we miss in Cato: the absence of these implies the
presence of corresponding defecta ι these defects (ea) are not,
however, natural, but are to be attributed to the influenee of
the teacher whose tenets he adopted. Editors say requirimus =

reprehendimus.
