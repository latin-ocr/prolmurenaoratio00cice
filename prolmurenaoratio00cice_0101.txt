Q. Pompeio: Quintus Pompeius Rufus, consul 13.c. 141, and
the first plebeian censor Rc. 131 : he fought against the
guerilla-ehief Viriathus in Spain and before Numantia. He is
said to have been the son of a flute player.

M. Aemilio: Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, twice consul (13.0.
115 and Β. ο. 107), censor B.c. 109, princeps senatus, and the
maker of the Via Aemilia from Ariminum to Placentia; cp.
Asconius, in Cic. pro Scauro, p. 20, verum Scaurus ita fuit
patricius, uc tribus supra eum aetatibus iacuerit domus eius

fortuna : nam ‘neque pater neque avus neque etiam proavus (ut
pato, propter tenues ope-s et nullam vitae industriam) honores
adepti sunt .· itaque Scauro aeque m· mmo homini laborandum

fust.
ammi: ’8Ρὶῑίὓί ingemi: ‘ talent’.
quam non acceperit: ‘which one has not received '. This
idiom is noticeable : when an Infinitive is used indefinitely
(i.e. without a subject) as here tradere (⁶ for anyone to hand
on') a subordinate proposition may be subjoined to such an
Infinitive, in the 3rd Person Sing. and without a. definite sub-
ject, the same subject being understood to which the Infinitive
might be referred, viz. ‘one' (Madvig); cp. de Orat. 1. 8, 30,
neque vero mihi quicquam praestabilius videtur quam pos-<se
ᾖ voluntates impellere quo velit, uncle autem velit deducere .· de
fin. 11¹. 21, 70, fatentur alienum esse a iustitia detrahere quid (le
'1⁴ aliquo, quod sibi assumat.
tradere: ‘to hand on’: Cicero says that it is just as
honourable for a novus homo to confer distinction on his

family, which has been hitherto unknown, by his own exer-
¹ tions and merits, as it is for a patrician to revive the fallen

fortunes of his house.
