fraudis : ‘snares, itfalls': (or perhaps ‘harm ², as in the
phrase sine fiuude). ne who did not understand the techni-
calities was likely to lose his ease through some informality.

§27. iure consultorum: the form iuris consultus is much
commoner in Cicero. The grammarian Charisius says, Iuris
consultus dici debet, ‘non iure consultus, licet Cicero pro Murena
ita dixerit.

ngeniis: ‘subtleties': depravata: ‘spoilt'.

muneres omnes All women, even those of full age,
were obliged to be under the control of a guardian, being sup-
posed to be incapable of taking care of themselves owing to
their feeble intellect; a way, however, was found by which,
instead of their being under the control of their guardians, the
latter became subordinate to them z women were permitted to
choose their own guardian (hence called optivus) on whom they
would naturally impose their conditions beforehand. Cp.
Gaius, 1. 144, veteres enim voluerunt semiim, etiamsi perfectae
aetatis sint, propter animi levitatem in tutela esse: ib. 150, in
persona tamen uxoris, quae in manu est, recepta, est etiam
tutoris optio, id est, ut lIceat ei permittere, quem velit ipsa,
tutorem sibi optare. Ulpian‚ XI. l,sem.i⁷1is (tutores constituuntur)
et propter sexus infirmitatem et propter =forensium rerum iyno-
rantiam.

continerentur : ‘ should be under the control of ⁹.

mera reperti sunt: Inherited property was often bur-
dened with the obligation of performing certain private
religious rites (sacra privata) connected with the worship of
some particular family3 as these entailed considerable ex-
pense, the following method of escaping them, in the case of
women, was adopted. The woman entered into a kind of
mock-marriage (coemptio) with a poor and childless old man,
whereby the whole of her property, together with the obliga-
tion of keeping up the sacra, passed over to the man3 the
woman was then almost immediately set free, and received
back the property piecemeal by way of gift (dono): the in-
demnification of the sacra, however, remained with the old
man until his death, when they became extinct (interierunt) as
he had no property to leave or children. We may notice the
proverbial expression hence derived (sine sacris hereditas) used
to signiiy ‘great gain acquired at litt-le trouble or expense':
lit. an inheritance unencumbered with the obligation 01· sacred
rites: cp. Plaut. trin. 484, cena hac annonast sine sacris
hereditas, i.e. during the present high price of provisions a
supper is as good as a leg-acy uneneumbered with expensos.
