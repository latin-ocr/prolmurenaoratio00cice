xxviii PRO L. MURENA.

the younger Servius.¹ . . . I now come to Cato, whose great
weight and authority, gentlemen, must not be allowed to
influence you in favour of a decision adverse to my client:
such influence ought rather to be directed to the assistance of
accused persons : it would be monstrous to imagine that Cato
would never have come into court as a prosecutor unless he
had already made up his mind that the defendant was guilty
(ἓ 57-59).

It is a pity‚ Cato, that you are such an uubending adherent
of Stoic principles: you would otherwise have behaved with
less harshness, and have moderated your language in the
Senate. Unite the affability of your great-grandfather with
your own strictuess, and the result will be a great improve-
ment (ξ 60-66).

Ι repeat, Cato's name and influence must be disregerded.
If the alleged offences can be proved against Murena, Ι shall
be as ready as he is to admit that he has acted illegally‚
and to press for his punishment (ἓ 67-68 conc-edam).

(1) It is said that ‘many went out to meet him on his
retirement from his provinee.' What is there in that? The
contrary would have been more remarkable: it was no more
than he deserved (ξ 68 multi obviam, ἓ 69).

(2) It is said that ‘ many followed him about in public.’ If
it can be proved that they were hired to do so, I grant it was
illegal: otherwise, nothing can be said against it. Do not
deprive the lower classes of this chance of showing their
gratitude (ἓ 70-71).

(3) It is said that ‘free seats at the shows were given to
whole tribes and meals to the people en masse) This cannot
be proved: the most that can be said is that such things were
done in a few caseS‚ but not in the case of all his ‘fellow-
tribesmen ' or of all the people, and this is the ordinary
custom, about which there is nothing illegal (ἓ 72-73).
