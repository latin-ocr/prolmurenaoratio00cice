you must remember that a good many of them would pro-
bably have preferred to see you in a province (ξ 42 postremo
—end).

I have shown, gentlemen, that each of the candidates had
equal claims to the consulship, but that in their respective
spheres of action Murena had distinctly the advantage : I now
proceed to state in what the further superiority of Murena

justify their conduct (ἓ 54-56).
