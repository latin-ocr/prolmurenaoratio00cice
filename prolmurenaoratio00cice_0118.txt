Cyzicus ⁵. Cyzicus is in Mysia, situated on an island or the
neck of a peninsula. It is called by Florus the Rome of Asia,
and was famous for the beautiful designs of its coinage

(Κυζικηνοὶ στατῆρες). The siege, fully described by Appian, .

is one of the most memorable in history. Others render
constitisset, ‘had settled down '‚ i.e. after the turbulent
campaign in Bithynia. Zumpt reads astitisset.

Caria, and Phrygia.

Varius, whom Sertorius had sent, the Paphlagonian Alexander,
and Dionysius the eunuch. Lucullus came upon the main
force of the three admirals in a barren island near Lemnos,
and entirely annihilated it. It is plain from the agreement
of our various authorities as to the date that this is the
same battle as that which Cicero mentions in pro Mur. §33
According to Cic. the squadron of the three admirals was
destined to sail to Italy, and stir up anew the civil war
