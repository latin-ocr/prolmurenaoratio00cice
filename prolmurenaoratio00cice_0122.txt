omen praerogativae: i.e. centuriae. The century to which
the lot assigned the privilege of voting first was called prae-
roqativa ,· its vote was considered of the greatest importance
aud practically decided the result; cp. Cic. pro Plancio, xx.
49, una centuria praeroyativa tantum habet auctoritatis, ut
nemo unquam prior eam tulerit, quin renuntiatus eit aut iis
ipsi-3 comitiis consul aut certe in illum annum. Its vote was
regarded as a kind of divine intimzzffion, hence the use of the
word omen. The word praerogyativa is used by itself in the
sense of an omen or intimation of something to come, a
choice, a precedent, and, in later writers, of a peculiar or
exclusive privilege, our ‘prerogative'. Others read here
praeroyacivum.
