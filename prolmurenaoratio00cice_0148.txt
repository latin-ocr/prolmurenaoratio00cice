§71. fructum: ‘return for'.

si nihil tenue est : i.e. if the only return they can make,
in order to show their gratitude, is to give us their vote, this
is a mere trifle (tenue) and hardly worth consideration, since
the ballot rarely came down so low in the comitia centuriata.

ut suffragentur, 1111111 valent gratiae. ‘for the purpose of
securing the votes of others, their innuence is nothin '. The
reading in the text is Kayser's. There is great dou t, how-
ever, whether suffrayari can bear the meaning given, especially
when coming so close upon praeter ipsorum suffrayium, which
seems to require that it be taken in its usual sense, ‘ to give
one's vote in favour of another ’. Perhaps the best way out
of the difficulty is to omit the words altogether (with Land-
graf, who also omits ipsi) as a marginal note upon praeter
ipsorum suffragyium. See Critical Appendix. ,

loqui dicere: obser-ve the distinction between these two

leg-i Fabiae : nothing is known of this law3 all that can be
said is that it was apparently of later date than the lex
Cornelia and lex Calpurnia, which dealt more with different
kinds of ambitus than with the sectatores, who had not at that

time developed into a nuisance.

quod erat L. caesare factum: in B.c. 64 the Senate, in
order to check the open bribery carried on by Antony and
Catiline, brought forward a new and more stringent law
against ambitus: it was, however, vetoed by the tribune Q.
Mucius Orestinus. This is generally considered to be referred
to here: but Halm, in view of the phrase quod est factum
(implying that the measure actually passed, and hence cannot
’ be the one above mentioned) refers to a senatus consultum,

concerning which nothing further is known.

restiterunt: ‘paid no heed to it': they preferred to run
the risk of punishment.

vetere instituto officiorum: ‘ old-established method of
showing respect ⁹.
