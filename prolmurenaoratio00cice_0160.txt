CRITIOAL APPENDIX.

THIS speech was unknown to the learned men of Europe be-
fore the fifteenth century. In the year 1418 Fr. Poggio
brought with him from Gaul the original MS. (or a copy of it)
to which all the other MSS. are to be referred. The original
is described by a contemporary as being in a dirty and dilapi-
dated condition, in places quite illegible (exemplar vetustate
decrepita, quod vir doctissimus Poggius ex Gallia reportaverat,
qui et huius orationis [pro Roscio Amerino]·et alterius pro
Murena repertor hac aetate fuit). It is now lost.

Any attempt to discuss the value or relation of the different
existing MSS„ or an elaborate critical appendix would be out
of place in a school edition, but, considering the amount of
attention the speech has received during the last ten years
from Continental scholars, and the numerous alterations that
have been introduced into the text, a few of the most impor-
tant variations may perhaps be here subjoined with advantage.
Some are also mentioned in the Notes.
