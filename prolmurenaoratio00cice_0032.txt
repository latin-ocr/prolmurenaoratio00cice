Everything, however, must give place to military ability,
to which the state owes its pre-eminence.

Cato attempts to prove that the war with Mithridates was
an unimportant one, and Mithridates an unworthy antagonist.
My opinion is that, if the duration of the war, the battles
that were fought, and the number of generals who took part
in it be taken into consideration, Mithridates was the most
redoubtable foe against whom we have ever had to contend
(ἓ 31-34).

The fact that your name was read out first at the electiori

nothing more uncertain than the whims of electors (ἓ 35-36).

Murena on that occasion laboured under two disadvan-
tages: (1) he had not the soldiers to support him, as the
army had not yet returned from Asia, and (2) he had given
no public shows. Both these disadvantages had been removed
when he was a candidate for the consulship (§ 37).

The support of the soldiers was of the greatest importance:

You refused to accept the government of a province.
Praiseworthy enough : but Murena’s acceptance of one was a
distinet advantage to him. You were certainly able to assist
your friends at home by your advice in matters of law: but
