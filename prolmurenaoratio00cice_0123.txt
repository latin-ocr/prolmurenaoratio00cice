vir fortis ε ‘a general epithet, without special meaning,
like our ‘ my honourable friend ³.

restituit: from this word it would appear that the equite-3
had in earlier times possessed some such privilege, but had
been deprived of it by Sulla. By the lex iudiciaria of O.
Gracchus the iudices were chosen from the equites instead of
the senators3 Sulla, by the lez Cornelia, transferred this
honour to the senators again; this arrangement was again
partially reversed by Cotta3 cp. Velleius Paterculus, 11. 32,
3, peridem tempus Cotta iudicandi munus, quod Ο. Gracchus
ereptum senatui ad equites, Sulla ab illis ad senatum trans-
tulerant, aequaliter in utrumque ordinem partitus est .· Ocho
