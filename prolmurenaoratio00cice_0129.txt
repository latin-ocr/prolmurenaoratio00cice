to touch them. The words addita est do not refer to any
special additional punishment infiicted if such an excuse was
alleged, but the meaning is that, if a man appeared before the
court when unwell, he ran the risk of still further aggravating
his illness, or, if he did not appear, of being condemned by
default. Zumpt refers the words to witnesses 01· jurmnen,
who stayed away on the plea of· illness with the object of
assisting the accused by their absence.

cui minime proderant ε as Cicero had attained the eonsul-

contusionem suffragiorum: ‘ promiscuous voting' ; voting,
not by tribes or centuries, but by heads, i. e. individual
citizens were to be called upon for their votes in no regular
order, but at haphazard: and then ‘by simply counting ’ it was

object of this was to do away with all distinction in voting,
so that no particular set of men or tribe or century should
secure any special influence, while, according to the old system,
the vote of the centuries of the first class was practically
decisive. It was also supposed that this method would
destroy bribery, for the votes of the several centuries would
not appear, and, as the people voted by ballot, and the money
was not generally paid till the election was over, no century
could claim anything for its services. The proposal was dis-
agreeable to the leading men of the Italian towns, for it was
, well known under the existing system how their votes would
be given, and, if a consul who was elected had received the
vote of any particular town, the chief persons thereby gained
great importance and influence, whereas the proposed confusio
merely eonfounded all the votes in one grand numerical
result. Against this explanation it has been urged that this
method of voting would have taken a long time, and that the
same end would have been attained if the centuries did not
