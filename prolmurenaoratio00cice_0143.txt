-g 66] NOTES. 105

ἕξεως ‘soon'. usus: ‘experience'. dies: ‘the course
ο une .

etenim : ‘ for these very teachers of yours themselves seem
to me to have extended the boundaries of moral duties rather
beyond what nature intended, in order that, having striven
in thought to reach the farthest limit, we might nevertheless
stop where we ought to do so ’. The meaning is z The Stoics,
by reason of the weakness of human nature, have done well
to ask from men more than they can perform in order that
they may be urged to greater efforts ; they ask more than
is necessary, in order that men may do what is necessary
(ut ubi oporteret, consisteremus). Cicero then roceeds
to give instances where the rigidity of the Stoic octrines
admit of modification.

fines protulisse: cp. the phrase fines imperii proferre
(to enlarge the boundaries of the empire).

n1h11 ignoveris: ‘excuse nothing’3 ‘the 2nd Person of
the Perfect Conjunctive is sometimes Permissive ; cp. ad
Att. vn. 8, nihil incommodo valetudinis seceris (do nothing

to the detriment of your health) ; this idiom corresponds to
{iel-nge of Fut. Ind. for Imperative', Pub. Sch. L. Gr. 1594,

tbi 1221,an aliquid: ‘nay rather, something, but not every· >

resistito permaneto: the Imperative Future is ‘espe-
cially used in legal formularies', and their employment here
serves to add pomposity to the style, ‘thou shalt resist...
thou shalt abide by ³.

1mmo resistito: i.e. not so ; resistit only when duty and
honour demand it, but make some concession to it in other
cases.

etiam t ‘ I quite agree, when it would involve an undue
relaxation of severity3 but, nevertheless, on occasion, mercy
is praiseworthy '.

vero : ‘ by all means ' 3 stronger than etiam.

566. scipio: Scipio Africanus Minor (B.c. 185-129). He
was a man of great literary taste, and one of the interlocutors
in the de senectute together with O. Laelius.

non paemtebat = delectabatur.

idem, quod tu: Cato took Athenodorus Cordylion from
Pergamum, and Antipater of Tyre to live with him. Both
were Stoics of some reputation.
