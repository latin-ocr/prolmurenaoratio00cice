NOTES.

Exordium, ξ 1-10.

C. 1. ξ 1. Quod precatus . . . sum: compare the commencement
of the speech post reditum ad Quirites z quod precatus α Iov'e
optimo maximo ceterisque dis immortalibus sum. The proceed-
ings at the comitia began and ended with a set form of prayer:
cp. Liv. xxxix. 15, consules in rostra escenderunt, et, contione
advocata, cum sollemne carmen precationis, quod praefari
priusquam populum alloquantur mayistratus solent, pereyisset,
consul ita coepit.

iudices: the full title of the speech is Oratio pro L. Murena
ad iudices. It deals with a crimina] case or causa publica, i.e.
one which concerns the whole body of the people, and not an
individual. Other modes of address were ad contionem,
before a meeting of the people summoned by a magistrate,
without reference to the division into centuries and tribes;
ad senatum, chiefly with a view to secure votes on political
matters; ad principem,—very common in the time of the
Empire—an appeal to the Emperor as jud e: of such a
nature were the speeches of Cicero on behalf ο Deiotarus and
Ligarius, which were heard before Caesar. For the composi-
tion of the jury, see Introd. p. xvii.

auspicato: ‘after the auspices had been taken’: this
Absolute use of the Pers. Pass. Participle ‘arises from the
Impersonal Passive construction of the Finito Verb, as
erratum est (a mistake has been made) '. Cp. Liv. v. 38, 1,
nec auspicato nec litato ,· so audito, errato, coquito, nuntiato.
On the morning of the day of meeting, the auspices were taken

Ι on the Campus Martius, and the comitia held or adjourned,

according as they proved favourable or the reverse.

renuntiavi ε ‘ declared duly elected ’ : the regular word for
the official announcement by the presiding magistrate of the
result of an election, which was preceded by a ‘proclamation
by the herald ( praeco).
