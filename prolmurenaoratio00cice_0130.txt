mined by lot, the election being over as soon as a majority
was recorded. This has been supposed to have been the plan
of the younger Gracchus ; cp. Sallust (?) epistola ad Caesarem
de rep. ordinanda: ut ex confueis quinque classibus sorti cen-
turiae vocarentur. This is the interpretation given by
Driimann, Geschichte Roms, v., p. 446, and Long, Decline of
the Roman Republic, 111., p. 274. According to Halm, this
proposal did not refer to elections generally, but to subsequent
electione held after any of the magistrates elect had been
convicted of bribery. The proposition was rejected by the
senate.

perrogationem-legis Maniliae: a rhetorical expansion of
confusio suffragyiorum. O. Manilius, tribune of the people,
had brought forward a law (3.0. 67) that the freedmen should
not only vote in the four tribus urbanae, but in all the 35
tribes, each in that of his patron. Cicero says that the
demand of Sulpicius for ‘ voting by heads ' was merely an
attempt to ‘carry through ⁷ the lex M anilia, for by the confusio
suffrayiorum the freedmen were practically put on an equality
with the rest of the citizens as far as voting was concerned.
The objection to this is that perroqare always seems to mean
‘ to ask votes in order '. Zumpt reads prorogationem, i.e. an
extension of the time of application of the Manilian law. He
refers it to some other law (of which nothing further is known)
which was originally passed only for a limited time.

· flh⁰m²¹²2⁶⁸ honesti atque gratiosi: ‘men of position and
111 Ueuce .

editicios iudices: the iudices which the law allowed to be
proposed (edere) by the accuser, as distinct from those chosen by
lot, of whom each party was allowed to re'ect a certain
number. Sulpicius proposed that the plainti should select
125 iudices out of the album (or list, made up by the praetore,
or, according to Dion Cassius, by the quaestors) iudicum from
the equites and tribuni aerarii (to the exclusion of the senators),
of which number the defendant should be allowed to reject 75.
By the lex Licinia de sodaliciis (eight years later) the accuser
was allowed to select the jury from the people at large: he

challenge one.

odia occulta: since an accuser might select iudices who ·

were personal enemies of the accused.
