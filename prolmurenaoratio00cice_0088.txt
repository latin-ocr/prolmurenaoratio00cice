50 PRO L. MURENA. ² ¹ [g]

mihi ndei magistratuique meo: ‘for myseff, my honour,
and my office ’. Cicero intentionally uses phrases from the
old established formulae employed on such occasions: cp.
Varro, de lingua latina, vi. 86 (of the electiori of censors),
quod bonum fortunatum felixque salutareque siet populo
Romano Quiritium, mihi colleyaeque meo, fidei maqistracuique
nostro.

populo plebique Romanae ε these words are a. reminiscence
of the time when the patricians, or ‘full' citizens, alone
formed the populus or body-politic of Rome, as distinct from
{he plebs, who were originally excluded from political privi-
eges.

bene atque feliciter eveniret: also part of a. solemn
formula: cp. Pliny, Panegyricus, ch. 72 (in reference to the
consuls appointed by Trajan), iam quod precatus est ut illa
ipsa ordinacio comitiorum bene ac feliciter eveniret nobis,
reipublicae, tibi. ”

ob obtinendum t ‘ when it is a question of maintaining’:
this construction is said to be specially used in archaic Latin
Zpghffiggllsformulae : it is also found in Sallust, who is fond of

salute: ‘ his civil status ². Cicero expresses the hope that
Murena may be acquitted of the charges brought against him,
{heaegepztegi which, if proved, would be so disastrous to him

et ut: i. e. et (precor) ut.

eaque res: i.e. this agreement (consensus to be supplied
from consentiant).

concordiamque ε when three or more co-ordinate nouus are
thus combined, either (a) each of them is connected with the
preceding by a conjunction, or (b) the conjunction is omitted
altogether, or (c) it is omitted between the first members and
que (not et, ac, or acque, unless it be desired to mark the last
member as distinct from the rest) is annexed to the last:
Madvig, ξ 434, obs. 1 ; cp. mihi fidei mayistratuiqvae meo
above, and honore sama fortunisque at end of ἓ 2.

vim: ‘weight, efficacy’. religionem: ‘sanctity’.

me rogante: sc. populum; ‘when I presided at the eleo-
{igpsiilssiu when I asked the people whom they would haye for

ξ 2. aut translata... aut communicata: cp. pro Rabirio,
11. 5, potestas iudicum proxime ad deorum immortalium
numen accedit.
