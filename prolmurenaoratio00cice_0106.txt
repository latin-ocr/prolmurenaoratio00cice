sub yolli cautum consultor ubi ostia pulsat.

respondeas: see on ξ 19.

bucinarum: the bucina was employed in giving the signal
· for changing the watches.

actionem instituis : ⁴ draw up a form of process ² ; instituere
is also (though not often) used in the sense of instruere (to
draw up an army in battle array). In like manner capia-ntur
is a military as well as a legal term, implying (1) be surprised,
(2) over-reached, and so lose their case. Actio is the general
term for legal procedure in a case: Ernesti, clav. Cio. s. v.‚

ut aquae pluviae arceantur: if any one diverted the rain-
water from his own property to his neighbour’s, and caused
any damage, it was open to the injured party to bring an
actio pluviae arcendae ,· this only applied to damage done to

sudden rising or outbreak in Italy, and also in Gallia

of all public business (iustitium). The locus claeeicus is
Philip. V111. 2, 3: potest bellam esse siue tumultu ,· tumultus
esse sine bello uon potest. quid enim est aliud tumultus, nisi
perturbatio tauta, ut maior timor oriatur? uude etiam ¹nomeu
ductum est tumultus, itaque maiores nostri tumultum Italicum,
quod erat domesticus, tumultum eumcum, quod erat Italiae
finitimus, praeterea nullum tumultum nominabant. aravius
