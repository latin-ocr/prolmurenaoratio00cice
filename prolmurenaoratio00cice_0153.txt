praetura deiectus est : the people were so disgusted with
his stinginess, that they refused to vote for his appointment
to the praetorship.

nam quod a1s suscipias? The general sense is: If, as
you say, merit is the only thing that ought to carry weight in
the appointment to public offices, why do you, who are a man
of such merit, seek the support of others? Perhaps you may
say that your object is to take me under your protection as a
magistrate ; surely in that case it would be more fitting that
I should first ask you to do so, rather than that you should
offer it.

ἓ 76. ,sordes et inhumanitatem: ‘meanness and want, of
manners .

rationet ‘ by a due regard of duties and circumstances '.
praesis : i.e. as a magistrate.

ἓ 77. nomenclatorem: candidates, when going round to
gain the favour of the people, paid the citizens visits at their
ouses, and shook hands with those they met (prensare): as
this would be more effectual if they were able to address them
by name, they were generally accompanied by a nomenclator,
or slave, whose business it was to whisper to them the names
of the citizens; cp. Hor. Ep. 1. 6, 50, mercemur servum, qui
dictet nomina. In earlier times the practice was not allowed ς
cp. Plutarch, vit. Cat. 8, νόμου γραφέντος, ὅπως τοῖς παραγγέλ-
λουσιν εἰς ἀρχήν ὀνοματολόγοι (nomenclatores) μὴ παρῶσι. ·

fallis et decipis: ‘ mislead and deceive'3 the distinction
between these two words is said to be ‘ that fallere denotes
that we are deceived by something which we do not know in
the character of the person or thing deceiving3 decipere,
by something which we hear, see, or know; or, that fallere
implies being deceived by something negative or indirect3
decipere, by something positive or direct ².

nam si ...salutas : Cicero says that Cato is equally guilty of
deception, whether he knows the names of his fellow·citizens
or not, if he employs the services of a nomenclator. If he
does not know them, it is deception to pretend that he does,
while all the time he has never heard of them until instructed
by the nomenclator. If he does know them, it is equally a
deception to pretend that he does not, and ostentatiously ask
the nomenclator the name first without waiting for him to
tell you as a matter of form. The passage sin etiam salutas

is thoroughly corrupt : the reading in the text may be trans· ι

lated, ‘But if, even though you are acquainted with thern,
their names must nevertheless be mentioned by your nomen-
