oreditable to build up the reputation of a ‘ new ’ family as to
revive the fallen fortunes of an old one. The last thing I
expected to hear thrown in the teeth of a consul-elect was
novitas generis : if it were a crime, I should certainly have

heard of it myself at the time of my own election to the con-
sulship. In the matter of birth and family there is nothing
to choose between you (ἓ 15-18).

You tried to make something out of the fact that your
name was announced first at the election for quaestorships:
but that is no criterion of merit: somebody’s name must
be given out first. As far as your tenures of office were
concerned, you neither of you had any opportunity of dis-
tinguishing yourselves, so that neither of you can claim
superiority to the other (ἓ 19).

Your subsequent careers were widely different. You,
Sulpicius, stayed at home and followed the legal profession.
Murena served under Lucullus abroad with the greatest
credit to himself, as is amply proved by the public despatches
of his general. Military renown gives a. man far greater claim
to the consulship than legal reputation. It is pre-eminence
in war that has won for us renown and empire: it is to our
soldiers that we have to look for their preservation (ᾖ 19-22).

You entertain too high an opinion of your profession as a
jurist. Military ability stands first, and oratorical power has
often been of service to the state: but your so-called pro-
fession is useless and paltry, depending, as it does, on mere
legal quia-ks and quibbles. In earlier times, when only a
certain class was in possession of the secrets of the law, it
may have been of greater importance : but, now that every-
body knows all about them, and they are at the service of
all, it is seen how worthless they are, and no one even takes
the trouble to ask your advice. Your profession is neither
diguified nor influential: power of oratory is of far more
use for the attainment of office (ἓ 23-30).
