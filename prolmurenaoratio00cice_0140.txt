102 PRO L. MURENA. [5 61

merely added to strengthen the idea of the simple verb: see
Prof. Mayor on Phil. 11. ἓ 42. The usage is especially
common in Plautus.

nos dieunt: ep. de orat. 111. 65, omnes qui sapientes non
sint, servos, latrones, hostes, insanos esse dicunt, de fin. Iv- 74,
stultos omnia contraria, quos etiam insanos esse vultis.

omnia peccata esse paria: cp. Diog. L. v11. 120, ἀρέσκει δέ
αὐτοῖς ἴσα ἡγεῖσθαι τὰ ἁμαρτήματα. According to the Stoica,
all vices were alike equal, as being deviatione from nature:
a sin was a sin, and there were no degrees of vice: cp. Hor.
Sat. 1. 3, 96, quis (Dative) paria esse sere placuit peccata,
laborant, cum ventum ad verum est: sensus moresque repuynant,
atque ipsa utilitas ; de fin. 1v. 19, sensus enim cuiusque, et
natura rerum, atque ipsa veritas (cp. ἓ 60 above) clamat
quodammodo, non posse adduci, ut inter eas res, quas Zeno
exaequaret, nihil interesset.

gallum gallinaceum: the Stoics, like the Pythagoream,
inculcated kindness towards animals.

nihil opinari: Diog. Laert. VII. 121, ἔτι δὲ μὴ δοξάσειν τὸν
σοφὸν, τούτεστι ψευδεῖ μὴ συγκατατίθεσθαι μηδενὶ. The wise man
never ‘ opines '‚ i. e. never assents to anything unless he is sully
convinced of it, aud consequently‚ when his mind is once
made up, never changes it.

C. XXX. ἓ 62. auctoribus eruditissimis inductus=auctori-
tate eruditissimorum : ‘ misled by the authority of most
learned men' 3 cp. pro Rosc. Am. § 117, induxit, decepit,
destituit. The omission of ab is to be explained by the con-
crete being put for the abstract, auctoribus for auctoritate ,· cp.
pro Mil. ἓ 47, iacent suis testibus : ‘ are overthrown by the
evidence of their own witnesses ; Iuv. Sat. 1. 13, adsidaew ruptae
lectore columnae = adsiduitate lectoris.

adripuit ι ‘ eagerly caught up ', without due consideration.

ita vivendi: ‘of living in accordance with them’; cp.
Tusc. disp. Π. 11, qui disciplinam suam non ostentationem
scientiae sed leyem vitae putant.

petunt aliquid publicani=si petunt a. p. .· cp. Iuv. Sat.
> 1v. 94, rides, maiore cachinno concutitur. The apodosis is:
then Cato, as a Stoic, will reply, cave , and so in what
follows. Cato was noted for his antipathy towards the
publicani or ‘farmers of taxes ’, who belonged to the eques-
trian order. For various reasons they often found themselves
obliged to ask the senate for some abatement in the terms of
their contract, and Cato’s influence was instrumental in bring-
ing about a refusal of their request3 cp. de Off. lv. 22, eqo
